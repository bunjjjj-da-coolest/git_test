hello world, one day i will be a competent developer.
i will  travel around the world and meet new people.
i will make my own open source social media for the people.
not addicting, no advertisements, no soul selling, no stress to conform.
it will be perfect (in my eyes)
no more metadata, or stalking.
no likes, only pure self expression.
people wont like it at first, because its different.
but different isn't bad.
the bare minimum social platform.
it will be great. ðŸ¤‘
